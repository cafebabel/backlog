        'title': "Lisbon: Nomad's land",
        'summary': "They are all over Lisbon. Sitting on café terraces, gathered in co-working spaces, at the beach to go surfing at the end of the day... But who are they? They are digital nomads. Seduced by travel, living the life and Wi-Fi, they have become so numerous that they've formed their own breed.",
        'body': '''
<p>You can find them on horseback in the Steppes of <strong>Central Asia</strong>, in <strong>Somaliland</strong> between city and sand, off the coast of <strong>Madagascar</strong>'s coral reefs, in the wide open spaces of <strong>North Africa</strong> or in the unexplored nooks of the <strong>US</strong>. In our imagination, nomads are people without a fixed home. But above anything else they are far away. Nomadism is an exoticism, a marketed one; the kind that resembles <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ga2-CXYeNU">a surrealist French summer hit</a> from the 90s, or a more internalised one of a tempting weekend in a yurt just an Easyjet flight away from home. </p><p>
So what are nomads doing in big European cities? We aren't talking about Bedouins or Mongolian shepherds, but about those who wander from café to café armed with stylish backpacks and their sticker-decorated MacBooks. Let's get something clear: today's nomads are no longer quite the same. Digital nomads, who have had <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computing-Across-America-Bicycle-High-Tech/dp/0938734180">glorious precursors</a> since the late 80s, have become somewhat common over the last two years. They have come to shake up our imaginations by embodying what it means to be a worker in the 21st century. Digital nomads are not a new version of backpackers, they are hard workers. Their only work tool is a good Wi-Fi connection, but they are hard workers nontheless, even if they enjoy travelling. Anywhere. All the time.</p><h3><strong>"I love my life"</strong></h3><p>
Still, as nomadic as they may be, these new millennials need a place to shine. If there was a <em>place-to-be</em> (<em>but-only-for-two-weeks</em>) for digital nomads this summer, it was (and still is) <strong>Lisbon</strong>. The Portuguese capital organises two events dedicated to this lifestyle, including the aptly-named Digital Nomad Conference organised by DNX, one of the many recent agencies to accompany, encourage and coach new nomads. But who is behind the event? <strong>Felicia Hargarten</strong> and <strong>Marcus Meurer</strong>, two Germans in their thirties who are already back in <strong>Brazil</strong> and who offer inspiring conferences and workshops to share their practical know-hows with nearly 600 nomads from 45 different countries. </p><p>
The LX Factory, which used to be a textile factory before it was converted in 2010 into a paradise for superior creative classes (designer boutiques, restaurants, co-working spaces and premises for start-ups, cooking school, etc.), hosts the digital horde. In an old but modernised warehouse with a bluish twilight, the weekend opens with an Instagram-type slogan: "I love my life." During their introduction, Marcus and Feli explain how their entrepreneurial journey began. It all started during a sabbatical in which the couple realised they could, in fact, continue working <em>while</em> travelling. After this introduction, <strong>Pat Flynn</strong>, a famous American podcaster in the field of 'entrepreneurial coaching' takes the stage. He also refers to his "perfect life" and everything he abandoned to overcome his fear of the future, to leave his comfort zone and finally feel accomplished.</p><p>
After an ice-breaker session where participants tell their neighbours what they are most proud of, there is a pause for meditation. Other speakers join the stage; the former digital director of <strong>Estonia</strong>, for example, praises the merits of <a href="https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/a-new-era-for-location-independent-entrepreneurs-has-begun-ece91cbf8876">e-residence</a>, a new method for digital nomads where they register themselves as virtual European citizens while living and working anywhere in the world. Entrepreneurs and coaches each take their turn insisting on the unconventional aspect of a digital nomadic life, on the inner-strength it requires, on the openness to oneself (and to the world) that it evokes. </p><h3><strong>Cool labour camps</strong></h3><p>
Whoever claims to be open to the world also ends up being a geographical name-dropper. A 25-year-old German in flip-flops, an ankle bracelet, black leggings and a plaid shirt sports a "<strong>Berlin</strong> – <strong>Sydney</strong> – <strong>Bangkok</strong> – <strong>Dahab</strong>" bag. A 22-year-old Dutch graphic designer is ready to become a nomad after a few test months of backpacking and working simultaneously. He "did" <strong>Bali</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong> and Eastern Europe. Naming the places you have visited are necessary, as the lifestyle revolves around travelling; the world is a checklist to be ticked off. </p><p>
According to Marcus and Feli', nomads are "people who love freedom and travelling, who are open-minded and want to grow. They want to bring about change in the world and aren't happy with the classic eight-hour working routine." The duo also organise two-week 'camps' all around the world, usually in nice locations (the next one will take place in <strong>Lemnos</strong>, a welcoming Aegean island). They aren't afraid of creating a myth of the digital nomad, who has their computer at the edge of the water and takes yoga breaks between their Skype calls. After all, "you can live as a digital nomad your whole life."</p><p>
There are even nomadic families with young children that find a sense of stability despite a hectic lifestyle. "Why not? As long as we love this way of life, there is no reason to stop," Feli continues, who thinks that "the important thing is to find a community and to be surrounded by people who have the same mindset." Many digital nomads live like this for a period of their lives; they spend a few years changing countries every few weeks or months. But, as a general rule (and this is often the case if one remains a nomad for a longer period) they also have one or more base camps where they can go back to their habits, their routines and their social lives.</p><p>
"The problem is that people in those locations don't want to meet us," <strong>Ash</strong>, a 30-year-old Indian explains. He has lived as a nomad for five years, never staying longer than two months in one place: "I have to go to <strong>Africa</strong>, I only know two or three countries there... It's not easy to integrate into local communities, they have no time to spare. They have their lives, their jobs, their friends and their families. Loneliness was a problem at one point."</p><p>
After five years of being a digital nomad, Ash, who is a software engineer but who "defines [work] depending on the opportunities," seems to be a little tired of the constant need to resettle. He met <strong>Rosanna</strong>, a 33 year old Portuguese/Dutch woman who had been a nomad for two years, and together they started a group to overcome this loneliness. She looked for other nomads on Facebook groups or Slack, but ended up dropping off flyers saying: "Do you work online? We should meet!" in several cafés. Rosanna and Ash now host a group of about 1,500 members, 500 of whom joined in the last two months, who meet at least once a week to discuss their common aspirations and issues and discover the Portuguese capital together while having drinks. The first thing a nomad does when they arrive in Lisbon? "Find a meet-up group, our group in particular, and meet people." </p><p>
Since remote work has <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/12/how-digital-nomads-went-from-niche-to-normal">no reason not to become widespread</a>, and tomorrow we might even live in <a href="http://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/">perpetual motion</a>, in self-driving cars, the notion of a fixed home might have to be revised; we may as well get used to the nomadic way of life. Rosanna defends a point of view that doesn't necessarily romanticise digital nomads. Sure, there's nothing wrong with kitesurfing and capoeira. But it's also important to work hard and, above all, to have professional skills in your field and more importantly: a network and customers that you can find amongst your peers while drinking a <em>porto tónico</em>. "I only have a sofa, a mattress and a table," Ash says. The typical digital nomad wants so much more than to own things. It's good because "when you live this lifestyle, it's very complicated to have a social status," Rosanna says, explaining that broke freelancers attend their events as much as those who do it for fun and are financially comfortable. </p><h3><strong>The "Portuguese spring"</strong></h3><p>
So why Lisbon? On a nomadic scale, the city reaches 3.67 out of 5 points. With an average internet connection of only 13 mb/s, a number of work places considered 'too limited', an "ok" air quality and nightlife, the Portuguese capital stays in the top 300 cities for digital nomads, trailing behind Asian (<strong>Bali</strong>, <strong>Chiang Mai</strong> and<strong> Bangkok</strong>) or European cities (<strong>Berlin</strong>, <strong>Barcelona</strong> and, the leader,<strong> Budapest</strong>). That being said, Lisbon is one of those places that the nomadic community appreciates for its quality of life [<em>NB. </em><em>Lisbon is ranked No. 1 worldwide on this criterion, <a href="https://www.internations.org/expat-insider/2017/the-best-and-worst-places-for-expats-39182">from the point of view of expats</a></em>]; the anti-cool mentality of Portuguese youngsters, its surf-spots and the special status for non-habitual residents, which makes it possible to reduce the base of their taxed income. </p><p>
Until today, Lisbon was losing inhabitants. That's 200,000 people in 50 years, meaning two thirds of the original population, that have left its historic centre. The crisis and austerity measure didn't help either. However, economists have been proposing a nicer story for some years now, one which includes a deficit that has never been so low, and the press talks about a "Portuguese spring". Nice. But is it true? Rosanna, who landed in Lisbon in 2015 after not having set foot in the city for six years, was "completely amazed". She had never known a Portugal that wasn't in a 'crisis': "When I came back, there was a positive energy that I had never felt before. In the past, the dream of Portuguese youth was to emigrate. Now, when finishing school, even if they don't necessarily have a job, you hear them say something like: 'Hey, let's try to do something here.'" </p><p>
The city can bounce back through tourism, whose income has increased by 10% per year on average over the past ten years and employs no fewer than one inhabitant out of eight today. But it can also bounce back through economic attractiveness, especially with regards to all things digital. The most beautiful catch of the city? The Web Summit – the largest conference related to new technologies, snatched from <strong>Dublin</strong> in 2016 – has become the city's new banner, while waiting for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/startup-hub-builder-factory-plans-gargantuan-new-campus-in-lisbon/">World's Largest Campus</a> dedicated to digital entrepreneurship that is being built in the former industrial district of <strong>Beato</strong>. Start-up incubators are displayed on billboards, trying to make people forget the debates related to the impacts of mass tourism for the city, an <a href="http://observador.pt/2017/09/06/taxas-taxinhas-turismo-e-o-colapso-dos-transportes-o-segundo-debate-dos-candidatos-a-lisboa/">unavoidable subject for mayoral candidates of Lisbon</a>. In this dreamy Lisbon, attractive and proactive, are digital nomads only passing through? "It's no use making plans," says Ash. "We will always do the opposite anyway," adds Rosanna.</p>

        'title': 'Cyprus: Twelve gods and a man',
        'summary': "Monotheism may still reign in Cyprus, but that isn't the case for Limpia. Here, polytheistic Cypriots gather to worship Dionysus. Between sacrifices, the Golden Dawn party and Zeus, this small village has a lot of thunder.",
        'body': '''
<p>In a small village situated 30 minutes from <strong>Nicosia</strong> called <strong>Limpia</strong>, which sounds a lot like ‘Olympia’, lies a temple dedicated to the Twelve Olympians. <strong>Georges Constantinou</strong>, a 43-year-old hairdresser, built the temple himself on his own land. In between a pasture and a wasteland, the view is surreal. Shining atop the temple in broad daylight are the words “ΕΛΘΕ ΖΕΥ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥ ΘΕΩΝ ΑΡΙΣΤΕ ΗΔΕΕ ΜΕΓΙΣΤΕ” (meaning “Come Zeus who is the greatest of kings, the most perfect, the most gentle”) carved in red. Georges hasn’t entirely finished building the temple. He proudly shows an image of what will soon be a mosaïc depicting <strong>Dionysus</strong> on his iPhone. The 12 pillars that hold the temple represent six goddesses and six gods, even if up to 30 000 gods are worshipped, according to sources. In the middle of the temple is an altar that serves as a kind of sanctuary. Hellenic Neopaganism, Pagan and Polytheistic are the terms associated with this religion, but Georges prefers to be called a “Greek national from Cyprus”.</p><h3><b>The temple's magical history</b></h3><p>
In <strong>Cyprus</strong>, as is the case with <b>Greece</b>, about a thousand people believe in a nostalgic and distant past: a time where we dedicated a cult to the power of the Twelve Gods. Although the separation of the church and the state didn't take place in Greece as it did in Cyprus, the subject is still taboo. This is why many young polytheists and other high-ranking people in Cypriotic society, such as senior army officers, want to keep their anonymity out of fear of being fired. An official organisation called the <em>Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes</em> was created in 1997 in <strong>Athens</strong>, and aims to get the religion officially recognised. "We are still a theocracy like <strong>Iran </strong>and <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>," Georges claims. "I find it scandalous that tourists have to pay to visit archeological sites, whereas I see them as sanctuaries." This could lead us to think that his temple has been built illegally, but in reality there's nothing fraudulent about it. Georges made a request to the state so that his temple could be recognised as a cultural structure. </p><p><img width="740" height="415"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="Chloé Emmanoulidis" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/07/25/douzedieuxtexte2.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/ec/7e/ec7e5a5fce97c580a61c199275ed18d3.jpg" title="Georges' temple." />Having been baptised, Georges had a traditional Christian wedding. After having leafed through the magazine <em>Epanellinisis </em>[<em>NB. meaning 're-hellenisation'</em>], he noticed a few things. "Everyone can become a Greek national, we don't want to impose anything on the individual, we don't ask them to join our religion, for example," he insists. Since that moment, he hasn't stepped foot inside a church or celebrated Easter–a holiday that is important to Catholics. "Christianity has destroyed everything. It was imposed on us and mocks us," he admits. Georges is actually referring to the time where the Roman Emperor <strong>Theodosius I</strong> reigned, between 379 and 395. The emperor converted to Christianity and persecuted pagans, idolisers of Antiquity. Under Theodosius I, Christians wanted nothing to do with antiquity and Paganism. According to some historians, Theodosius I was the forerunner of the Byzantine Empire. </p><p>
Georges is a part of the cult group called "Μόρφω" [<em>NB. "beautiful" in Ancient Greek</em>], who gather 12 times a year to organise ceremonies and respect a very rich calendar. According to their official almanac, every festivity is linked to the ethical practice that relates to their god's qualities. For example the month of July sees the start of the zodiac sign Leo, and is the month in which <strong>Zeus</strong> dominates, so virtues of justice and good social order are practiced. Each god has their own hymn. "Our cult connects us with our ancestors, and that's why every participant is a saint," Georges explains. For the Greek nationals, the word "god" doesn't mean the same as it does in monotheism. For them, gods are entities, they form a whole. For them, ancestors play a huge role in their religion. "Why is the dominant religion in <strong>Egypt</strong> Islam, when their ancestors are <strong>Anubis</strong>, <strong>Isis</strong> and <strong>Osiris</strong>?" shouts Georges. </p><h3><strong>"Death is a part of nature"</strong></h3><p>
As with any religion, Greek Cypriots have their rituals. They dress in togas like the Ancient Greeks and place milk, honey, wine and flower crowns on the altar as an offering, lifting their arms to the sky and praying to the gods. When thinking of polytheists, we often think of meat sacrifices the ancients would give but Georges smiles: "Nature is the crux of it all, we don't make animal sacrifices." They don't have a bible and are not represented by a prophet, but their scripture is the 147 maxims carved on the Temple of Apollo at <strong>Delphi</strong>. </p><p><img width="739" height="410"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="Chloé Emmanoulidis" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/07/25/douzedieuxtexte.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/3a/f9/3af9b9a74649683602042e23ff6e6fcc.jpg" title="The cult team." />Needless to say, philosophy plays a big role in their religion. The meaning of life, death and love is not the same as in Christianity. For Georges, "death is a part of nature. We shouldn't see death as something scary, the way it is depicted in Christianity. What happens after death is a philosophical question." Georges expresses himself in Greek with hints of Ancient Greek: "What interests us is the most perfect and excellent life." For him, "Christianity transformed values into shame. Sex is still taboo, whilst in ancient Greece that was not the case." In the end, polytheism doesn't impose rules on one's daily life, but merely gives suggestions to practical questions using ancient Greek philosophies. </p><p>
It's for this reason Hellenic Neopagans are sometimes linked to nationalist parties, like the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in Greece. Why? Because they use the same ornamental pattern called the "Greek key pattern" and also love the ancient Greeks. "This is the label Christians want to put on us. We don't have anything to do with political parties," Georges assures. The orthodox Cypriot priest <strong>Constantinos Kyriakides</strong> understands atheists and other religions. But for him, studying the works of <strong>Cicero</strong> or <strong>Confucius </strong>or a Greek tragedy is not the same as loving Apollo or Dionysus 15 centuries after their disappearance. "The resurgence of ancient religions in nationalist slogans vary–I admit that it's a bad habit–and their aspirations are entirely foreign to the culture and spirituality," he insists. </p><p>
But for Georges, being a Greek Cypriot is more than a religion, it's a way of life. A perpetual search for ancestry and the meaning of being Greek. But first, he's going to have to roll up his sleeves and finish this mosaïc that will bring the finishing touch to one of the only temples dedicated to the Greek Cypriot gods. </p>

        'summary': "Everybody talks about what Amsterdam-Noord used to be and how it has changed, for better or for worse. What was once a neighbourhood for sailors, merchants and craftsmen has become the newest escape from the madding crowds in the city's centre. With a heavy influx of new hip bars and students looking for cheap housing, will the neighbourhood be able to keep its true roots?",
        'body': '''
<p>“You know those cows that, in the springtime, are finally released into the wilderness? The ones that are hopping and skipping around?” That’s what it feels like for <strong>Floor</strong>, a 25-year-old student, to step off the ferry from the city centre and bike into <strong>Amsterdam-Noord</strong>. The neighbourhood is more like a borough and is situated north of the <strong>IJ</strong>, a river that separates the central part of<strong> Amsterdam</strong> from its northern region. Jokingly referred to as ‘<em>Noord gestoord</em>’, which roughly translates to ‘the crazy North’, the neighbourhood that used to be considered Amsterdam’s neglected little brother is quickly becoming an oasis of peace compared to the city’s bustling central neighbourhoods.</p><p><img width="740" height="498"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="Cafébabel" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/11/20/plan_MMH_Amsterdam-Noord.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/6a/c6/6ac6b81faba4bfedb5c194531ba39a67.jpg" title="Amsterdam-Noord" />It is easy to access as there are three different ferries taking pedestrians and cyclists to Amsterdam-Noord. Upon arrival, the sharp contrast between suburban housing and intense industry is as clear as day. Although there is still a sense of authenticity from the old, post-war housing and nearby factories and warehouses, the influx of the new is in contention with the old. Everybody talks about what Amsterdam-Noord used to be and how it has changed, for better or for worse. What is still an area rich in local culture and diversity is under threat by the wave of new developments that are capitalising on the neighbourhood’s true roots. </p><p>
Back in the 1600s, sailors, craftsmen and merchants who worked in the maritime industry inhabited Amsterdam-Noord. It was only logical for them to settle here as it was close to Amsterdam’s ports and the IJ River. However, when the city became too crowded in the early 1900s, <strong>Floor Wibaut</strong> built the <strong>Vogelbuurt</strong> in Amsterdam-Noord for people who needed access to affordable housing. As time passed, a lot of large industries started leaving the neighbourhood, and the industrial part of Noord known as <strong>NDSM Wharf </strong>became a desolate wasteland of abandoned buildings and empty lots. </p><p><img width="740" height="494"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="© Antinea Radomska" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/11/20/DSC07617.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/3a/21/3a21314761faa080ad192645c9b45eef.jpg" title="Industrial vibes close to the NDSM wharf. " />Today, NDSM has completely transformed. The wharf is home to <strong>Ij-hallen</strong>, a monthly flea market that is one of the biggest in <strong>Europe</strong>. It is also home to some of the best music festivals in the city, and has become scattered with trendy bars such as <strong>PLLEK</strong> and <strong>Noorderlicht Café</strong>. The striking contrast between the looming shadow of Amsterdam’s industrial past along with the remains of the NDSM shipyard and this new buzzing young social scene is not to be missed.</p><p>
But there are gems of Amsterdam-Noord’s past that have been kept intact. <strong>Café Sluisje</strong> is a perfect example. It’s a historic ‘brown café’ that sits alongside a canal lock on the picturesque <strong>Nieuwendammerdijk</strong>. A few years ago, the bar was shut down due to bankruptcy, but has since been revived as a cooperative that is owned by locals from the community. Although its owners were hesitant to speak on camera, they had a lot to say about the way in which Amsterdam-Noord has changed. They share the opinion of a lot of Northerners who, in seeing how much the neighbourhood has changed, can’t decide whether it’s a good or a bad thing.</p><p><strong>Matìas</strong>, a 45-year-old Argentinian man who works in an empanada restaurant close to Amsterdam-Noord’s authentic <strong>Pekmarkt</strong> (a market open three days a week), has lived in the neighbourhood for five years. Much like the owners of Café Sluisje, he believes that the way in which Amsterdam-Noord has changed has impacted its community in different ways. While some people can benefit from a new demographic coming in, others inevitably suffer from the weight of gentrification. It is not unimaginable that, in 10 years, Amsterdam-Noord will be unrecognisable to those who grew up here. </p><p class="video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" frameborder="0" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KzCkCeNJ2p8" title="Video player" type="text/html"></iframe></p><h3><strong>The people</strong></h3><p><img width="740" height="536"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="© Antinea Radomska" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/11/20/karl_MMHamsterdam.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/b9/45/b9459f89ebbfc1c5dd8dfcd3c5982c9b.jpg" title="Karl Gerritse, studying to be a doctor." /></p><p><img width="740" height="536"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="© Antinea Radomska" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/11/20/matias_MMHamsterdam.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/b8/25/b825bf417beabddefb834620f058d120.jpg" title="Matìas, master of empanadas." /></p><p><img width="740" height="535"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="© Antinea Radomska" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/11/20/jianda_MMHamsterdam.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/7b/a5/7ba511524c6fe05f31b420796f0c489c.jpg" title="Jianda, one of the many house cats in Amsterdam-Noord." /></p><p><img width="740" height="536"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="© Antinea Radomska" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/11/20/floor_MMHamsterdam.jpg"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/d4/2a/d42aa35627115287bc9f6733ec43e854.jpg" title="Floor, who feels like a cow who's been set free when she comes to Amsterdam-Noord." /></p><h3><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h3><p><img width="740" height="410"class="img-width-3 img-left" data-copyright="Cafébabel" data-copyright-url="" data-media-path="uploads/2017/11/20/How much Amsterdam Noord-07.png"  src="http://m.cafebabel.com/cache/c2/17/c21746b689c39eeb72353d4920a8fa25.jpg" title="A coffee, a room and a pint." /></p><h3><strong>Hotspots in Amsterdam-Noord:</strong></h3><h4><em>Café 't Sluisje</em> (Nieuwendammerdijk 297): A nice balance of old and new.</h4><h4><em>La Cocina Empanadas</em> (Van der Pekstraat 93): Fresh and delicious empanadas and bomb chimichurri.</h4><h4><em>Café de Ceuvel</em> (Korte Papaverweg 4): Sustainable and unique urban development + bar + restaurant + workplace.</h4><h4><em>Oedipus brewery</em> (Gedempt Hamerkanaal 85): Craft beers in a psychedelic atmosphere.</h4><h4><em>EYE Film Institute Netherlands</em> (IJpromenade 1): A museum, restaurant and cinema all at once; amazing modern architecture and exhibitions.</h4><h4><em>Pekmarkt</em> (Van der Pekstraat): Open on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday until 5 pm.

        'summary': "As Italy flirts with the idea of legalisation, the city of Bologna already seems to be laying the groundwork for cannabis to blossom. Mild weed shops, stressed students, street dealers... everyone seems to be benefitting from the herb whose trade can bring you out in a cold sweat. Report.",
        'body': '''
<p>Monday morning, 9 am – the sky is blue over <strong>Via Zamboni</strong> and the surrounding neighbourhood, where most of the University of Bologna department buildings are located. <strong>Francesca</strong>* is late for her first class, but she would have liked to have had a bit of a smoke before starting her day. Unfortunately, she finished her stash yesterday and there's not a soul in sight on <strong>Piazza Verdi</strong>. Too bad, she'll have to ask one of her uni classmates. <strong>Marco</strong>* usually sorts her out. Worst comes to worst, she'll have to find some later on in the day. </p><h3><b> Hemp supporters</b></h3><p>
Finding cannabis in <strong>Bologna</strong> isn't hard. Despite having a small city centre, there are three main areas for suppliers: the <strong>Pratello</strong> district in the west, the <strong>Montagnola</strong> park near the station and the Piazza Verdi in the east where the main student centre is. Not far from there, on <strong>Via Indipendenza</strong>, there's a slogan on the ceiling of one of the city's many archways: "<em>Panis vita, cannabis protectio, vinum latetita</em>" [<em>"Bread is life, cannabis is protection, wine is joy"</em>]. The inscription is a reference to the historic production and trade of hemp in the region, and could easily become the motto the province <strong>Emila-Romagna</strong>'s capital city once again. </p><p>
Since the 16th of May, it has been legal to consume 'light' weed in Bologna. Thanks to the shop <em>Qui Canapa</em> (meaning "Hemp Here") that has been open since February 2016 and selling marijuana legally since May 2017, curious and newly-converted clients have been visiting the shop weekly. It is the first of its kind in <strong>Italy</strong>. In the shop, which feels like an organic supermarket, weed can be found in many forms: dried, liquid, oil... A bag of 8 grams costs 17 Euros, and many cannabis-based products are temptingly laid out on the shelves and display racks.</p><p>
The shop was set up by <a href="https://www.easyjoint.it/">Easyjoint</a>, a local company, after 15,000 people attended the major cannabis show in Bologna last May. Qui Canapa's aim is to become <em>the</em> epicentre for everything weed-related in Italy. The company also describes the shop as "an informative place", which it is. The large information posters stuck to the mauve walls along with the information that is found on their website all focus on the various uses of hemp; anything from cosmetics to textiles. The very same website also encourages those who are keen to open their own Qui Canopa shop. The staff highlight the serious nature and expertise of the company ("15 years of experience in the industry"), and boast that they have received nearly 2,000 orders after their attendance at the exhibition last May. Since then, similar shops (and competition) have sprung up in the Red City, as Bologna is known, as well as other parts of Italy, like <strong>Milan</strong> and <b>Naples</b>. </p><p>
But what is 'light' weed? It's <em>Eletta Campana</em>, a variety of hemp that has been used for a long time in Italy – especially in Emilia-Romagna's textile industry – with a THC [<em> Tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychotropic element of cannabis - ed.</em>] level that is under 0.6% (the legal limit). Unlike Indian hemp, 'light' weed has no psychotropic effects but enhanced relaxing, calming and sedative effects. The Easyjoint company hopes that selling this kind of weed will encourage the smooth passage of legalisation of the sale and consumption of cannabis in Italy. </p><h3><b>"I switch my brain off"</b></h3><p>
Fracesca could queue up outside Qui Canapa to restock, but the 25-year-old is not a big fan of the legal weed. "I've always been fascinated by hallucinogens in general," she says, "so this aspect of the drug [the psychotropic effect] is essential for me. Otherwise, I might as well just have a cigarette." Like most of the other young people in town, she prefers to go looking for weed – the real stuff – in the winding streets of the Red City, where you can find a gram for 10 Euros. </p><p>
Hundreds and sometimes even thousands of students come to Bologna every month to spend money on their weed needs. Given that the sale of cannabis is illicit, it's hard to determine an exact figure on the size of the market. At any rate, cannabis consumption in Bologna is <a href="http://www.today.it/cronaca/droga-citta-italiane.html">estimated at over 60 daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants</a>, which is well over the national average. Francesca "smokes to pass the time", and her consumption has always been "a pleasant activity," without her every becoming "too dependent". <strong>Leonardo</strong>*, however, smokes almost every day; too much stress, too afraid of failing his academic year. When he thinks back to his university years, the 23-year-old <strong>Apulia</strong> native recalls having lived in a cloud of smoke during his sound-engineering courses. "Smoking is a way for me to take my mind off of my obsessions," Leonardo confides, "It gives me a break. At uni, there are moment where you risk a complete psychological breakdown. So smoking weed gave me a moment of peace, calm and relaxation. Basically, I switched my brain off." </p><p>
Leonardo doesn't really look like a typical panicked student. He's a young man with dark, curly hair, a soft look and a smile on his lips. If the former student had cold sweats about his upcoming exams, it was due to the daily pressure. According to a PISA report published in April 2017, Italian students are amongst the most stressed in the world. 86% of young Italians worry about not getting good grades, in contrast to 66% on average in OECD countries. 56% admit to being nervous when revising for an exam, and 70% to being "very anxious" while taking it. </p><p>
Well above the average of their European neighbours, these numbers (which relate to 15-year-old pupils) could equally be applied to university students, given the state of the Italian job market. In fact, the employment rate amongst young Italians is 37%. 16% of graduates will find themselves unemployed at the end of their studies. With 385,000 inhabitants, Bologna is by no means the most populated city in the country. However, it has one of the highest levels of students in Italy. According to <a href="http://statistica.miur.it/scripts/IU/vIU1.asp">statistics</a> from the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR), 78,026 students were registered at the University of Bologna while only 60,134 were registered in Milan and 64,886 in <strong>Turin</strong>. </p><p>
Does the concentration of students in the Red City make it a giant stress ball? Whatever it is, there are people there to create a zen space, according to Leonardo. "Bologna is a strange reality. At 10 pm, if you go down to Via Zamboni, Piazza Verdi or Via Petroni, it's very likely that you'll be asked at least three times if you want something to smoke. If you want weed, there's someone who can supply it every hundred metres." If you walk around during the day, you might not notice these little groups of dealers who more or less blend in with the crowds at Piazza Verdi. In the evening, though, it's different story. Via Petroni comes alive when the bars open and students tussle for vodka shots and spritzers for 2 Euros. Street vendors shout "Beer, beer!" and more and more dealers emerge, ready to supply the partying students in the darkness of the city's archways. </p><h3><strong>"We're talking about a serious issue"</strong></h3><p>
People who buy from the streets are mostly one-time smokers, Erasmus students, first years or passing tourists. These first-time customers attract the least trustworthy dealers and give Piazza Verdi a bad reputation of having unsmokeable weed. That's partly why Francesca doesn't like buying from dealers, she usually gets her weed from friends or acquaintances: "I've always tried to avoid those kinds of places. The weed is cut with harmful substances and the quality is rubbish," she whispers. What's more, the areas in Bologna known for selling poor-quality weed feed an ecosystem that in turn attracts an increasing amount of hard drugs. </p><p>
According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiciton (EMCDDA), around one in five Italians between the ages of 15 and 34 consume cannabis, which puts the country in second place just behind <strong>France</strong>. But in Bologna, the territory is also suitable for other kinds of drugs: heroin, ketamine and amphetamines. On the 18th of July, a gang mainly made up of Pakistanis was arrested in possession of 3.3 kilos of heroin. Every gram was destined for dealing in the strongholds of Bologna. </p><p>
The pressure of increasingly prolific and increasingly dangerous dealing is also worrying the neighbours. The Serendippo organisation, created in 2007 in the little <strong>Viccolo de’Facchini</strong> street, a few metres from Piazza Verdi, aims to promote dialogue between local residents. The founder, <strong>Etta Polico</strong>, is familiar with the problems linked to pockets of dealing activity. The street her organisation works in is considered as being "at high risk of deterioration." Dealers, fences and addicts have gradually ruined the image of what was once a peaceful district. "Bologna is an example of a city where you can find drugs anywhere, anytime," Etta Polico explains, "Everyone finds themselves mixed up in it to varying degrees, from the students, to doctors, to professors." </p><p>
Last year, during a workshop on reclaiming public spaces, Etta met a 17-year-old schoolgirl who was interested in the campaign. During their conversation, the girl blithely confessed that she earned some pocket money selling ketamine and weed on Friday and Saturday nights. “As if it was the most natural thing in the world. She added that many of her friends did the same,” Etta Polico continues, “That’s just one of the stories about kids and the impact of illegal drugs in Bologna.”</p><p>
“We are talking about a serious issue here, which is too often and too easily conflated with an immigration issue,” Serendippo’s founder goes on. “The ones who are vilified are usually the weakest links in the chain like the North Africans dealing in <strong>Via del Guasto</strong> and Piazza Verdi. But in fact they are not the ones who are responsible for this.” Then who is? Etta can't give details but she knows what the city <em>isn't</em> doing. Her organisation has been talking to the city's authorities for 10 years. “Bologna does very little. You can find intelligent people in the local authorities, but most people who work there have a bad habit of not ever going out onto the actual streets. You can stay in your own little corner concocting theoretical approaches, but if you never get up close to the people involved you’ll never get great results,” she explains in detail. According to her, the police are turning a blind eye. “That makes me laugh,” Leonardo confesses, “There’s at least one patrol a week at Piazza Verdi, by the theatre. Their brief is to watch the building, and just the building, never mind if two guys are killing each other 50 metres away. Occasionally they’ll give someone a bit of hassle but it’s just to maintain the illusion of being in control.”</p><p>
And what if Bologna’s apathy reflects the beginnings of a political change at a national level? For quite a while, Italy has been on the verge of legalising cannabis, while never taking the final step. This is because of the Church, according to some, or alternatively the Mafia according to others, or because of the government’s lack of ambition according to many. One thing is certain: for many of Bologna’s citizens, legalising cannabis would be a breath of fresh air. “I think if we legalised cannabis, criminal behaviour would reduce massively,” Etta Polico states. <strong>Gianluca</strong>, a teacher, even thinks that “soon cannabis will not even be considered a drug.” That would perhaps give Bologna back what it used to have: the title of the “European hemp capital” where “Cannabis is protection.”</p><p>

        'summary': "With the sweltering heat that is hitting Europe this summer, it’s amazing the nudist community hasn’t grown. In fact, it’s shrinking. But amidst the decline, one sports club in Berlin has managed to attract nudists with their activities. This is what it’s like to play volleyball naked.",
        'body': '''
<p>I pick up the volleyball and look up. An older man of at least 60 is doing squats about an arm’s length away from me, and his crown jewels are dangling underneath him. I regret this instantly.</p><p>
It’s 7pm on a Monday, and I am standing in the draughty gym of the <strong>Albert Graefe School</strong> in <strong>Kreuzberg</strong>, <strong>Berlin</strong>. Dress code? Nothing but my sports shoes and socks. Eight other naked men, some in their twenties and thirties along with two old-timers, are passing some volleyballs around. Everyone is passing, chatting or stretching while <strong>Mike</strong> is putting away the 4 Euro payments in his fanny pack. Mike is the volleyball organiser of the <strong><a href="http://www.fsv-adolf-koch.de/">Adolf Koch Familien-Sport-Verein</a></strong>, a family sports club. A “family sports club” that only offers nude sports. They offer nude table-tennis, nude yoga classes, nude water sports and, of course, nude volleyball. It’s a classic <strong>FKK</strong> organisation, which stands for <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freik%C3%B6rperkultur">FreiKörperKultur</a></em>, meaning ‘Free Body Culture’.</p><p>
Before I know it, I am listening to Mike explain some volleyball exercises in German. I understand quite a bit and realise that I just have to go with it. I might be butt-naked in a school gym, but I will show them what I got. I tell the man next to me in my best German that I am not even that good at volleyball, and that I am mostly here as a journalist. He laughs and passes me the ball. I take a deep breath and practice a sprawl dive with the ball to <strong>Julian</strong>.</p><p>
The club’s name comes from <strong>Adolf Koch</strong>, who was the leader of the FKK movement before the war and had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Koch">an interesting relationship </a>with nude culture and the ruling party of his namesake. <strong>Germany</strong> has a rich history of nudism; while it has become a bit of a taboo in the <strong>US</strong> and the <strong>UK</strong>, it has always been more enshrined in <strong>Europe</strong>’s holiday traditions. <strong>Feargus O’Sullivan</strong><a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/04/fight-over-naked-parks-beaches-germany/523710/"> writes that </a>“rather than sexualizing the body, the naturist movement sought to free people from shame and the social inequality to which clothing often gave expression.” He goes on to say that before 1989, specifically in the communist and secular Eastern European states, it was common to try to make a distinction between work and relaxation by literally separating the two activities with two different costumes. The Nazis <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/fkk-im-dritten-reich-koerperschau-mit-nacktmodellen-a-949380.html">even propagated</a> nude male models, but then took a step back in order to create a more uniform male society. The post-war Left had their own way of looking at it, and a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/freikoerperkultur-a-948549.html">leftist nudist magazine</a> even had a slogan saying: “We are naked and we call each other <em>Du</em>.”</p><p>
“We have been playing volleyball here almost every week since 2012, right?” Mike (28) looks to Julian (31) as we sit in the locker room for our little interview, this time dressed for the occasion. “He got me into it,” Mike says while pointing to Julian. “I’ve always been playing ‘textile volleyball’ and Julian was already into FKK, we found this sports club and it was all really exciting.” The two men now live in a nudist apartment with two other roommates and are very happy to talk to me about their lifestyle.</p><p>
“A lot of people do it in Germany,” Julian explains, “there are FKK camping sites, yoga clubs, holiday tours, nude beaches, and many other activities. I have been going on FKK holidays for years now. It’s all about being connected to your body and feeling completely free. Also, while playing sports, it’s more healthy because you can see your body and you get more feedback from your body. It’s just very different with clothes on.” Mike quickly concludes his friend’s statement: “And it’s also more practical as you have to bring less sports clothes!”</p><p>
I grab the ball and I am ready to serve. Adrenaline is rushing through my veins. It’s 24:23–a setpoint for us. For a first-timer, I have been playing well. Julian even came up to me and complimented me earlier. I can’t help but realise I am loving the sports side of things. In general, it’s a relaxed atmosphere, but some of the men get quite competitive about whether a ball is in or out of the playing field. We play about six different sets up to 25 points, and all come together at the net to high-five each other when a team wins a set. For anyone watching from the sidelines, it must have been a ridiculous sight. Eight men, wearing nothing but shoes and socks (and the occasional kneecap) huddling up at the net.</p><p>
In the locker room I jokingly ask them if wearing kneecaps isn’t cheating. “Protection first, right?” Mike says. Then I ask the question that was on my mind for some time: “Is there no sexual connection at all? No tension?” Mike laughs, and Julian says: “Not here. I mean… you never know the motivations of everyone who comes here. But here it is all about being completely free. This automatic association between being naked and sexuality is strange, we think. It’s only because you are normally always in clothing and only really take them off with other people during sex. If anything, there’s an aesthetic element to it. You do everything about your body and with your body. Clothes take that away.”</p><p>
While FKK organisations are <a href="http://www.mopo.de/reise/fkk-vereine-klagen-hilfe--keiner-will-mehr-blank-ziehen-4855640">losing their members at a fast rate</a>, Mike and Julian tell me that they saw a steady increase in the members at the Adolf Koch Sports Club. Giving a reason for the general decline, they allude to the heated debate and numerous bans on nude bathing, <a href="http://www.swp.de/ulm/lokales/kreis_neu_ulm/voehringer-buergermeister-vor-fkk-dialog-14697684.html">for instance at a lake</a> in Southern Germany, and an <a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/vermischtes/article207932607/Staatsschutz-ermittelt-nach-Beschimpfungen-am-FKK-Strand.html">increase in harassment </a>towards nudists. But they admit that a rise of smartphones with cameras and an increase in tourists isn’t helping the open FKK culture they used to know and love.</p><p>
Asked if they had a message for young Europeans looking for a new element to their weekly dose of sports, Mike said: “Trust yourself, it might be difficult to go for the first time. But a lot of people told us that they see it as a key experience in life. So, try it out. It’s liberating.” Julian nods and smiles. “You are here for the second time now, aren’t you?”</p><p>
It’s 24:23. I throw the ball in the air and at that moment I snap out of my competitive mindset and realise there are seven men in this room looking at my naked self jumping up to serve. I completely miss-whack the ball and it bounces on the net. I stand stuck to the ground for a few seconds. What am I doing here?</p><p>
It’s 24:24. No time for naked thoughts. Let’s go. “<em>Du bist dran!”</em> I yell, while I throw the ball over the net. We were naked and we called each other <em>du</em>.</p>
